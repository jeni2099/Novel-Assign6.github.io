        <h3>Harry & The philosopher's Stone</h3>
        <p>Late one night, Albus Dumbledore and Minerva McGonagall, professors at Hogwarts School of Witchcraft and Wizardry, along with groundskeeper Rubeus Hagrid, deliver an orphaned infant named Harry Potter to his aunt and uncle, Petunia and Vernon Dursley, his only living relatives.</p>
        <p>Just before Harry's eleventh birthday, owls begin delivering letters addressed to him. When the abusive Dursleys refuse to allow Harry to open any, Hagrid arrives to personally deliver Harry's letter. Harry is a wizard and has been accepted to Hogwarts. Hagrid takes Harry to Diagon Alley for school supplies and gives him a pet owl he names Hedwig. Harry buys a wand that is connected to the dark wizard Lord Voldemort's own wand. Harry learns his parents have left him a fortune kept in Gringott's Wizarding Bank. Also, Harry is famous for surviving the same lethal curse that Voldemort cast to kill Harry's wizard parents, James and Lily Potter. The curse rebounded off Harry, destroying Voldemort's body, and left a lightning-bolt scar on Harry's forehead.</p>
        <p>At King's Cross station, Harry boards the Hogwarts Express train. He meets Ron Weasley and Hermione Granger, a Muggle-born witch. Harry also encounters Draco Malfoy who is from a wealthy, pure-blood wizard family. The two immediately form a rivalry. At Hogwarts, Students assemble in the Great Hall where the Sorting Hat sorts the first-years among four houses: Gryffindor, Hufflepuff, Ravenclaw, and Slytherin. Harry is placed into Gryffindor alongside Ron and Hermione. Draco is sorted into Slytherin, a house noted for dark wizards.</p>
